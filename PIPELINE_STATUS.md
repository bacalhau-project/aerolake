# Pipeline Status: WORKING âœ…

**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Status**: End-to-end pipeline operational
**Last Verified**: 2025-09-02 16:00:38

## Working Components

### 1. Infrastructure âœ…
- **EC2 Instances**: 2 Bacalhau nodes running (`bacalhau-ip-10-0-1-240`, `bacalhau-ip-10-0-1-229`)
- **Services**: bacalhau.service and sensor.service active
- **Container**: `ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/databricks-uploader:v1.16.0` operational

### 2. Data Flow âœ…
- **Sensor â†’ SQLite**: Database created at `/opt/sensor/data/sensor_data.db`
- **SQLite â†’ Bacalhau**: Mount path `/opt/sensor/data` â†’ `/data/sensor_data` working
- **Bacalhau â†’ S3**: Successfully uploading to `expanso-raw-data-us-west-2`
- **Upload Frequency**: Every 15 seconds, ~45-50KB JSON files

### 3. Current Job âœ…
- **Job ID**: `j-c1e5b00b-23fc-4a6d-847e-153f24863f5c`
- **Status**: Running in background (`--wait=false`)
- **Executions**: 2 nodes, both `BidAccepted` and `Running`

## Key Resolution Notes
- **Database Mount Issue**: Fixed by ensuring sensor service creates DB before uploader runs
- **AWS Credentials**: Resolved directory vs file mounting issue
- **Clean Git History**: Removed all sensitive data, single clean commit `ee59eb5`

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check job status
bacalhau job describe j-c1e5b00b

# Monitor S3 uploads
aws s3 ls s3://expanso-raw-data-us-west-2/

# Check services
systemctl status bacalhau.service sensor.service

## Next Steps

â€¢ Monitor for continued data flow
â€¢ Set up Databricks Auto Loader when ready
â€¢ Consider monitoring dashboard implementation

--- Pipeline fully operational and uploading sensor data to S3 ðŸŽ‰ EOF

# Add to git and commit

git add PIPELINE_STATUS.md git commit -m "Document working pipeline status

â€¢ End-to-end data flow operational
â€¢ Background Bacalhau job running successfully
â€¢ S3 uploads confirmed every 15 seconds
â€¢ All major issues resolved and documented"
